# Image carousel planning

## Does the program have a user interace?

1. Background color for entire page.
2. Image carousel is centered in the page.
3. Vertically centered wide div contains all slides and encompasses entire viewpoint width.
4. 5 equal divs that make up that wide div. Center one is the "picture frame" that shows current carousel item. Others are hidden.
5. Arrows on each side of the carousel with SVGs that control moving forward and backwards in the carousel.
6. Set of five horizontal circles below the picture frame portion of the carousel. Likely with SVGs. Tapping anyone enables jumping directly to that slide in the frame.
